Name:                Soutei
Version:             2.1
Synopsis:            a logic-based trust-management system
Description:
    SOUTEI is a trust-management system, a dialect of Binder, for access
    control in distributed systems. Soutei policies and credentials are written
    in a declarative logic-based security language and thus constitute
    distributed logic programs. Soutei policies are modular, concise, and
    readable. They support policy verification, and, despite the simplicity of
    the language, express role- and attribute-based access control lists, and
    conditional delegation.
